# Day 2: Python Core Concepts

This folder contains Python programs covering **variables, input/output, loops, and functions**.

## Programs

1. **01_variables_input_output.py**  
   - Demonstrates variable assignment (string, int, float, boolean)  
   - Shows input from user and prints output  

2. **02_add_two_numbers.py**  
   - Takes two numbers from user and prints the sum  

3. **03_even_odd.py**  
   - Checks whether a number is **Even** or **Odd**  

4. **04_pass_fail.py**  
   - Takes marks input and prints **Pass** if >= 40, else **Fail**  

5. **05_loops_even_odd.py**  
   - Uses loops to print all even or odd numbers in a given range  
   - Includes option to select Odd or Even  

6. **06_simple_interest.py**  
   - Demonstrates a **function** to calculate simple interest  
   - Takes principal, rate, and time as input and prints result  

## Notes
- Input/output handled via `input()` and `print()`  
- Loops and conditionals are used extensively  
- Functions are introduced for modular code
